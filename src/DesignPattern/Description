A design pattern is like a reusable blueprint for solving common problems in software development.
It's like following a set of proven guidelines and best practices to create a well-structured and
efficient solution to a specific type of problem.

Imagine you're building a house. Instead of starting from scratch
 every time, you use architectural plans and templates that have been refined
 over time. These plans ensure your house is stable, safe, and functional.
 Similarly, design patterns provide developers with templates and strategies to address
 recurring software development challenges, making their code more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand.

In essence, design patterns help developers build software more efficiently by offering
established solutions to common problems, just as architectural blueprints help builders construct houses more effectively.
