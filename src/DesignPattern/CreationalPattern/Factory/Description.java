public class Description {

/*    The AnimalFactory interface declares the createAnimal() method, which is responsible for creating an instance of Animal. The DogFactory and CatFactory classes implement the AnimalFactory interface and provide the implementation for creating Dog and Cat objects, respectively.

            Here's a real use case for the Factory Method pattern:

    Consider an application that processes different types of documents, such as PDF,
     Word, and Excel. Each document type has its own parser and processor. Rather than having conditional statements in the application code to handle each document type, you can use the Factory Method pattern.

    The Document interface defines the common behavior for all documents.
    Each document type, such as PDFDocument and WordDocument, implements this interface and provides its specific implementation.

    The DocumentFactory interface declares the createDocument() method, which returns an instance of Document. The PDFDocumentFactory, WordDocumentFactory, and ExcelDocumentFactory classes implement the DocumentFactory interface and provide the
     implementation to create their respective document types.

    By using the Factory Method pattern, the application can create the appropriate document object without being tightly coupled to the concrete classes.
     It allows for easy extension when adding support for new document types, as you can simply create a new factory class that implements the DocumentFactory interface.

    Overall, the Factory Method pattern promotes flexibility, encapsulation, extensibility, and adheres to the principles of object-oriented design.*/
